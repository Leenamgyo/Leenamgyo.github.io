## Introduction

SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.

## Why Tailwind?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

### Installation

1. Create a project
2. Add Tailwind
3. Start coding!

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
