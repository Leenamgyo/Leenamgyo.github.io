Hello! I'm **Jimmy Cai**, a software engineer and designer. I built this theme, **Stack**, to help bloggers focus on their content while having a beautiful and functional site.

This is a SvelteKit port of the original Hugo theme. It aims to replicate the design and features while leveraging the power of Svelte and Vite.

## What I Do

I specialize in building modern web applications with a focus on performance and user experience.

*   **Web Development**: SvelteKit, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
*   **UI/UX Design**: Creating intuitive and beautiful interfaces
*   **Open Source**: Contributing to the developer community
