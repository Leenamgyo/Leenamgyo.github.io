Hello! I'm Jimmy Cai, a software engineer and designer. I built this theme, Stack, to help bloggers focus on their content while having a beautiful and functional site.

This is a SvelteKit port of the original Hugo theme. It aims to replicate the design and features while leveraging the power of Svelte and Vite.

### What I Do
